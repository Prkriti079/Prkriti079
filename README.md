### 🧠 About Me
I’m **Prkriti Puri**, a passionate **Data Science graduate student at the University of Michigan–Dearborn** with a strong foundation in **software engineering and analytics**.  

Previously at **HSBC** and **Inferess**, I worked on projects spanning **data automation, cloud pipelines, API development, and dashboarding**, bridging the gap between data insights and scalable engineering.  

I enjoy building solutions that blend **data-driven intelligence with clean, efficient code** — whether that’s a predictive model, an ETL workflow, or a full-stack application.  

Driven by curiosity and continuous learning, I’m currently exploring how **AI, cloud computing, and data engineering** can empower smarter decision-making and better user experiences.
